Description: The synapter package provides functionality to reanalyse
        label-free proteomics data acquired on a Synapt G2 mass
        spectrometer. One or several runs, possibly processed with
        additional ion mobility separation to increase identification
        accuracy can be combined to other quantitation files to
        maximise identification and quantitation accuracy.
